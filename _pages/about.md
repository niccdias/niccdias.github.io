Hello there! My name is Nic Dias, and I am a PhD Candidate at UPenn. In May 2025, I will become a post-doctoral fellow at Aarhus University, where I will be working on the [PARTYOPINION](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/researcher-websites/rune-slothuus/current-research/) project under [Rune Slothuus](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/researcher-websites/rune-slothuus/).

I want to understand how well democracy is working and how it can work better. My dissertation challenges the long-held idea that citizens' policy opinions are generally "unprincipled" --- that is, inconsistent with their underlying values and interests. Instead, I argue that citizens' opinions appear less principled than they are, due to flaws in how scholars have evaluated citizens' opinions. In other work, I have studied polarization's causes, consequences, and potential remedies. You can find a list of my publications and working papers on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XudGcdkAAAAJ) and on the [publications](https://niccdias.github.io/publications/) section of this website.

I love teaching, and I care a lot about my students. In Fall 2025, I will teach a seminar at Aarhus University on why millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump. I have served as a teaching assistant to [Intro. to American Politics](https://live-sas-www-polisci.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/node/8993) and [Intro. to Data Science](https://live-sas-www-polisci.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/node/9007). And before pursuing my PhD, I led workshops for journalists on how to monitor social media for misinformation, check the authenticity of claims and images, and write effective corrections. If you are a former student of mine, please say hello!

If you want to contact me, send an email to [niccdias@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:niccdias@sas.upenn.edu). I would be happy to hear from you.
