Hi! My name is Nic Dias, and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. In May, I will become a post-doctoral fellow in the Political Science Department at Aarhus University, where I will be working on the [PARTYOPINION](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/researcher-websites/rune-slothuus/current-research/) Project under [Rune Slothuus](https://ps.au.dk/en/research/researcher-websites/rune-slothuus/).

I want to understand how well democracy is working and how it can work better. My dissertation examines how well citizens form policy opinions that align with their underlying values and interests. It challenges the long-held idea that citizens' policy opinions are generally unprincipled. Instead, I argue that citizens' opinions appear less principled than they are, due to flaws in how scholars have evaluated citizens' opinions. In other work, I have studied the causes and consequences of polarization, as well as how polarization can be addressed. You can find a list of my publications and working papers on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XudGcdkAAAAJ) and on the [publications](https://niccdias.github.io/publications/) section of this website. 

If you want to contact me, send an email to [niccdias@sas.upenn.edu](mailto:niccdias@sas.upenn.edu). I would love to hear from you!
